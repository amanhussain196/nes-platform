Place your .nes Game ROM files in this directory.
The application will automatically detect them and list them on the dashboard.
Example: SuperMarioBros.nes

NOTE: Multicarts like "1200-in-1" are often NOT supported and will crash the emulator. Please use single game ROMs (Mapper 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
